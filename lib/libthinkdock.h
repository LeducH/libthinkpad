         * A graphics processing unit has so-called Video Display Controllers

         * The VDC takes the data from the GPU and encodes it in an abstract format
         * that defines position, resolution and refresh rate.
         *
         * A GPU can drive only up to n-available VDCs, which means that a GPU
         * can't output more unique images than there are VDCs.
         *
         * However, a VDC can mirror the data to another output.
         *
         * For example, the Lenovo ThinkPad X220 has 2 VDC's and 8 outputs.
         * That means that the X220 can display up to 2 unqiue images that define
         * resolution, position and refresh rate, but those 2 images can be mirrored
         * and displayed on up-to 8 outputs.
         *
         * If you connect a projector to the VGA port and mirror the ThinkPad
         * screen to that, we are only using a single VDC to drive two outputs.
         * It is favorable for the outputs to share a common output mode that
         * both displays support, for ex. 800x600.
         *
         * The second VDC is not used and is disabled.
